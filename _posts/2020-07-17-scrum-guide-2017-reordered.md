- The Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the product Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

- Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones.
- More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail.
- Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can be reasonably “Done” within the Sprint time-box.
- Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within one Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning.
- Product Backlog items usually acquire this degree of transparency through the above describes refining activities.
- The Development Team is responsible for all estimates.
- The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.
